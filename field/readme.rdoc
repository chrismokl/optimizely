Test Name: 
	Reg Wall - Step 2 Form Fields Removal

Test Description: 
	The Sign Up form has 2 steps:
		Step 1) Enter valid email address
		Step 2) Enter First name, last name, and password

	Step 2 causes a lot of drop offs, losing X% in sign-ups.

	This test will see if we can achieve a lift in sign up rates by getting rid of Step 2 of the process, by having First Name, Last name, and password automatically filled out.
